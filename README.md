#Introduction
In this project I will be looking at the IMDB viewer reviews for Game of Thrones.
Plan:
- I will import the rating, date and review into a pandas dataframe 
- I will then do some EDA to see how the the ratings changes with time
- I will then bin the ratings into three bins (1-3, 4-6, 7-10) and test what words are used in a given rating bin
